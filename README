      RPG-41 - The Quest for an A
****************************************

The purpose of this assignment is for you to bring together your knowledge of
data structures to put together a fun and exciting roleplaying game.

The theme of the game and design of the world can be whatever you want.

You must meet the following design criteria for an A (one letter grade per
criteria met):
1. All actions in combat must have a delay (for example, attacking with a
dagger might have a short delay, but a greatsword a high delay). Implement a
data structure to control when the actions actually take place using a heap.
2. You must have fights capable of supporting 3+ actors in it at once. (An
actor could be the player, allies, monsters, etc.)
3. You must use a linked list, BST, or hash table somewhere in the game code,
and in a meaningful way.
4. You must implement a world map with the ability to display at a minimum:
a) The player
b) Monsters (who carry money on them that you loot when you win)
c) Walls (that are normally impassible)
d) Lakes (that are normally impassible)
e) Treasure (that could be visible, or buried treasure)
5. You must win the game when you collect 100 gold pieces, or lose when you
reach zero health.
